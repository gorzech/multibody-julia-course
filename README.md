# Programming Multibody Systems with Julia

## Description

The post-graduate level course consisting on programming spatial, rigid multibody dynamics using Julia programming language. 

The course will be delivered at Warsaw University of Technology during spring/summer 2025. 

## Setup

Please refer to file with [setup description](<environment_setup.md >).

## Content

The course consists of:

- 24 hours of lectures in four 2x3h blocks

- 28 hours of labs interspersed with lectures

- 8-hour hackathon project, optionally in teams

- Additional 2x3h lectures after the hackathon
